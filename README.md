Polar Codes with SCL and SCL List Decoding
Description
This project explores the implementation and performance of Polar Codes, a type of error-correcting code, and their decoding using Successive Cancellation List (SCL) and SCL List Decoding. Polar Codes, first introduced by Erdal Arikan, are a groundbreaking coding scheme for achieving the Shannon capacity of binary-input discrete memoryless channels. This project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of Polar Codes and demonstrate the efficacy of SCL and SCL List Decoding algorithms in enhancing decoding performance.

Additionally, the project incorporates Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) to further improve the error detection and correction capabilities. CRC is a powerful tool in identifying and correcting errors in transmitted data, providing an extra layer of reliability.
